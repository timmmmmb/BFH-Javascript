Thanks again..you guys are awesome!" -- Jacob Cheriathundam "Just finished ng-book2. I think it is the best learning material one can find about Angular today." -- Jegor Uglov FAQ What version does the book cover? This revision of the book covers up to angular-4.1.0 . An updated version of the code is available for free at our website. Do I have to know Angular 1? Nope! We don\'t assume that you\'ve used Angular 1. This book teaches Angular 4 from the ground up. Of course, if you\'ve used Angular 1, we\'ll point out common ideas (because there are many), but ng-book stands on its own Is ng-book an upgrade to ng-book 1? No. This is a completely new book and shares no content or code with ng-book 1. Angular 1 and Angular 2+ are two different frameworks and ng-book 1 and ng-book are two different books.', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5192lzDZ7zL.jpg'),

Managing data gets messy, handling browser incompatibilities takes time, juggling competing user interactions and integrating the work of multiple developers gets tricky. The Angular 2 framework handles these common problems, making it ideal for writing large-scale web applications that can be maintained, extended, and tested. Because it\'s popular, it offers a well-supported code base, vibrant community, and rich ecosystem. Best of all, Angular 2 emphasizes performance and focuses on mobile apps by being compact and memory efficient. Angular in Action teaches readers modern application development with Angular 2. It begins with the basics, such as key features of TypeScript, newer ES6 syntax and concepts, and details about the tools needed to write professional Angular 2 applications. Next, readers learn how to build an Angular 2 application from scratch. Using many examples, the book teaches the core parts of Angular 2, such as Components, the Router, and Services. It also covers techniques like server-side rendering and incrementally adding Angular 2 to existing Angular applications. Finally, if offers insight into advanced skills, such as testing, tooling options, and performance tuning.

This is especially true on the web, where you also need to ensure that the state is reflected in the URL. In addition, you might want to split applications into multiple bundles and load them on demand. Doing this transparently isnâ€™t easy. The Angular router solves these problems. Using the router, you can declaratively specify application states, manage state transitions while taking care of the URL, and load bundles on demand. This book is a complete description of the Angular router written by its designer. It goes far beyond a how-to-get-started guide and talks about the library in depth. The mental model, design constraints, and the subtleties of the API-everything is covered. Youâ€™ll learn in detail how to use the router in your own applications. Predominantly, youâ€™ll understand the inner workings of the router and how you can configure it to work with any edge cases you come across in your sites. Throughout the book, youâ€™ll see examples from real-world use in the MailApp application. You can view the full source of this application and see how the router code works to manage the state of the application and define what is visible on screen. Reading this book will give you deep insights into why the router works the way it does and will make you an Angular router expert. What you will learn Understand the role of the Angular router and how to make the most of it Build and parse complex URLs Learn about the componentless and empty-path routes Take control of states in your application Make use of imperative navigation Understand guards and how they can benefit your applications Optimize configuration and run tests on your routing About the Author Victor Savkin has been on the Angular team since the inception of Angular 2.
